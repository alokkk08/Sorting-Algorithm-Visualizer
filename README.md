# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
Description: Developed an interactive web application to visualize various sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. The tool allows users to dynamically generate arrays, choose sorting algorithms, and adjust sorting speed, providing a clear visual representation of each algorithm's process.

Key Features:

Algorithm Visualization: Implements visual representations for Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
Dynamic Array Generation: Allows users to generate random arrays of adjustable size.
Speed Control: Users can modify the sorting speed using a range slider for better observation of the sorting process.
Interactive UI: Provides a user-friendly interface with buttons and sliders for a seamless experience.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Structured the content and user interface.
CSS: Styled the application with modern design elements, including responsive layouts and custom slider styles.
JavaScript: Implemented sorting algorithms and interactive features using asynchronous functions and DOM manipulation.
